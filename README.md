## Svitle Radio

This is a mobile app for [Svitle Radio](https://svitle.org/), a Christian radio
station in Kyiv, Ukraine.

Written in React Native, it supports both iOS and Android and uses a simple JSON
API to discover station metadata.

JSON API is also open source, available [here](https://github.com/knyar/svitle-api)
